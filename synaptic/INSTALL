Install:
--------

Installation should be straightforward. Just type:
 ./configure
 make
 su -c 'make install'

You need gtk-1.2 or WINGs to compile. I suggest using the gtk version,
as from 0.20 on, the wings version is basicly unsupported (I will not
add any new features to it, but try to keep it working). From 0.24 on,
the WINGs version is only build if you enable it with "--with-wings"
in configure.

If you have any questions, suggestions or bugreports, send a email to
